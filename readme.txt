CONTROLS
	To play this game use WASD to move the snake to collect the fruit, orange blocks.
	Don't run into the wall or eat yourself or you will lose the game.
	To win, eat 20 fruit. Win faster for more points. Softcap time limit at 30 minutes.

Our program deserves 100 points because we used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript properly. There is no big div 
containing everything, the style sheets are easy to read, and the script is properly commented. All three validation
tests pass. The game is contains no errors and provides a hard experience for the player. The HighScore API was incorperated 
correctly and a readme was submitted with this assignment.

CSS FEATURES
	Text effect on the title.
	An animation above the canvas.
	Transition on the start button.
	
JAVASCRIPT LIB
	We used JQuery
	
BEAR TO IMPLEMENT
	The food was the hardest to implement. We had to spawn the food on the correct tile so the snake can eat it.

HIGHSCORE API
	We commented out line 319 in order to run the game. Once highscore is good, you "should" only have to uncomment
	that line.
